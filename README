A short comment on the project I hand in:
In my project I created a basic machine translation model. I devided the whole process into three parts which resulted in three files that are expected to be run in the following order:
(1) Preprocessing of data stored in '1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb'
(2) Word embedding with Word2Vec stored in '2_Word2Vec_Word_Embedding.ipynb'
(3) Actual machine translation model stored in '3_Translation_Model.ipynb'
Each file can be executed separately. To guarantee this there might be some duplications in the code. Also at the beginning of 'Word2Vec.ipynb' and 'Final_Translation_Model.ipynb' I put some basic function to load the previous results of the other files as well as functions to save intermediate results for the reuse in the other files. 

Note on the machine model: Due to a lack of time and no GPU I could not train the model for many training steps. Therefor the accuracy is really bad. I hope this is no problem!
